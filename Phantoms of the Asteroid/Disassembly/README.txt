The important files are:

Phantoms of the Asteroid (Version a) - B0.txt - The disassembly
Phantoms of the Asteroid (Version a) - B0.PRG - The binary file on which the disassembly is based
Phantoms of the Asteroid (Version a).tap - The game as a TAP file (My original source).

There is also a "Phantoms of the Asteroid (Version a) - B5.PRG" file which is the same as "Phantoms of the Asteroid (Version a) - B0.PRG",
but saved with a different BANK setting in CCS64. This file is not important.


How to run:
Load "Phantoms of the Asteroid (Version a).tap" into CCS64
or load "PHANTOMSCRACKEDV2.PRG"
or load "freeze - POTA - V3.c64" and type SYS30210


Tools used:

-	My own old VB6 program to make the initial disassemly file
-	UltraEdit for editing and adding comments to the disassembly file (TABs will not line up in Notepad)
-	CCS64 to deduce stuff (using breakpoints and my patched versions of the games)
