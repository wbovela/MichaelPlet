The important files are:

SHADOWCRT B5.txt - The disassembly
SHADOWCRT B5.PRG - The binary file on which the disassembly is based


Tools used:

-	My own old VB6 program to make the initial disassemly file
-	UltraEdit for editing and adding comments to the disassembly file (TABs will not line up in Notepad)
-	CCS64 to deduce stuff (using breakpoints and my patched versions of the games)
