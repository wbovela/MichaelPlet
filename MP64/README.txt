MP64 is my own homemade C64 emulator.
It does not compare to "professional" emilators like CCS64 or VICE.


Rename .xe to .exe.


MP64 is started by running MP64.exe.
Properties are set in Properties.txt.
If you want the screen resolution to change, run as administrator.
The resolution will change back when exiting MP64.

Keyboard is used as on a C64 with these additions:

Esc = Exit MP64
F12 = Reset
F10 = Load PRG file. The PRG file must be in the \Prg folder
      and the filename must be entered without .prg extension

Joystick (Port 2) is controlled by:

Delete   = FIRE
Numpad 8 = UP
Numpad 4 = LEFT
Numpad 6 = RIGHT
Numpad 2 = DOWN

Joystick (Port 1) should be one key up from these.

For some reason MP64 is slower on my new PC than on my old.
Maybe it is because of different sound card or graphics card.


Look at .frm and .bas to see source code!
