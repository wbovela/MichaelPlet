The important files are:

Hero of the golden talisman.txt - The disassembly
Hero of the golden talisman.prg - The binary file on which the disassembly is based
Hero_Of_The_Golden_Talisman.tap - The game as a TAP file


How to run:
Load Hero of the golden talisman.prg into CCS64 or VICE
or load Hero_Of_The_Golden_Talisman.tap into CCS64 or VICE


Tools used:

-	My own old VB6 program to make the initial disassemly file
-	UltraEdit for editing and adding comments to the disassembly file (TABs will not line up in Notepad)
-	CCS64 to deduce stuff (using breakpoints and my patched versions of the games)
