The important files are:

DEAD ZONE B5.txt - The disassembly
DEAD ZONE B5.PRG - The binary file on which the disassembly is based
DEAD ZONE B5 - Patched.PRG - A patched version which watches two memory locations
Patch.txt - The disassembly of the patch
Dead Zone.tap - Game as a TAP file (My original source)

There is also a "DEAD ZONE B0.PRG" file which is the same as "DEAD ZONE B5.PRG",
but saved with a different BANK setting in CCS64. This file is not important.


How to run:
1) Load "DEAD ZONE B5.PRG" or "DEAD ZONE B5 - Patched.PRG" into CCS64
2) Type SYS39680
