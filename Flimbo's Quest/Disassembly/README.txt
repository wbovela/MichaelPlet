The important files are:

FLIMBO05.txt                      - The disassembly
FLIMBO05.PRG                      - The binary file on which the disassembly is based
Flimbo's_Quest_-_Side_1.tap       - The game as a TAP file
Flimbo's_Quest_-_Side_2.tap
Clean_Flimbo's Quest_Side A-2.tap - My own transfer of the original tape
Clean_Flimbo's Quest_Side B-2.tap
FLIMPAT.c64                       - A patched version (saved as a CCS64 state) to watch variables
Patch.txt, Patch2.txt             - Assembly version of the patch


How to run:
Load state FLIMBO1.c64 into CCS64
or load Flimbo's Quest.d64 into CCS64 or VICE
or load Flimbo's_Quest_-_Side_1.tap into CCS64 or VICE
or load the patch FLIMPAT.c64 into CCS64


Tools used:

-	My own old VB6 program to make the initial disassemly file
-	UltraEdit (11.10b) for editing and adding comments to the disassembly file (TABs will not line up in Notepad)
-	CCS64 to deduce stuff (using breakpoints and my patched versions of the games)
