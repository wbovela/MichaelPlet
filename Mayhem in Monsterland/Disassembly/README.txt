The important files are:

MAYHEM05.txt - The disassembly
MAYHEM05.PRG - The binary file on which the disassembly is based
MAYPAT0.c64 - A patched version which watches two memory locations
Patch2.txt - Assembly version of the patch

There is also a "MAYHEM00.PRG" file which is the same as "MAYHEM05.PRG",
but saved with a different BANK setting in CCS64. This file is not important.


How to run:
Load the state (freeze) "MAYHEM1.c64" or the patched version "MAYPAT0.c64" into CCS64


Tools used:

-	My own old VB6 program to make the initial disassemly file
-	UltraEdit for editing and adding comments to the disassembly file (TABs will not line up in Notepad)
-	CCS64 to deduce stuff (using breakpoints and my patched versions of the games)
