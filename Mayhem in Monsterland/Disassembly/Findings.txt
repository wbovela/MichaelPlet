Slopes are constructed like this:

I changed some chars in blocks to FF and let the screen redraw.
Mayhem fell through the holes, but the enemies didn't.
So the enemies don't do collision detection.

I changed some chars on screen (but not in blocks) to FF and Mayhem fell through the holes.
I changed some chars in blocks (but not on screen) to FF and Mayhem didn't fall.
So Mayhem does collision detection against screen (not map).
