This is a C# program to locate C64 character sets in a PRG file.
I use it as a tool to assist in my disassembling of C64 games.

The zip-fil contains the entire VS 2019 (Community) solution.
After extracting rename .xe extension to .exe for files in bin\Debug and obj\Debug folders.

To run start FindCharacters.exe and use the menu to navigate to and select a PRG file.
The Message Box first shown is just the start and end addresses of the PRG file.
Then use the scollbar to scroll through memory.
Now the characters are shown in Hires and in Multicolor. The addresses are shown in hex and decimal.
