The important files are:

DRWHOB5.txt - The disassembly
DRWHOB5.PRG - The binary file on which the disassembly is based
Patch\ - This folder contains the disassembly of a patch to show variables.
         And some CCS64 state files with patches showing different variables.
D64\ - This folder contains the original game and PRG files extracted from it.

There is also a "DRWHOB0.PRG" file which is the same as "DRWHOB5.PRG",
but saved with a different BANK setting in CCS64. This file is not important.


How to run:
Load "D64\DOCTOR WHO.PRG" or one of the patched states into CCS64


Tools used:

-	My own old VB6 program to make the initial disassemly file
-	UltraEdit for editing and adding comments to the disassembly file (TABs will not line up in Notepad)
-	CCS64 to deduce stuff (using breakpoints and my patched versions of the games)
