        <h3><font color="#FF9900" face="Comic Sans MS">Using Block
        Types</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Each scenery block in a map has a &quot;Block Type&quot;
        associated with it which defines how Rayman, his enemies and other
        events in a level react to the block. A block in a flat grassy platform may have a
        &quot;Solid Type&quot; which means that Rayman can walk on it. Snow in
        the Mountain World may have a &quot;Slippery Type&quot; which means that
        Rayman will slide on it. Spikes in the Cave World may have the &quot;Death
        Type&quot; assigned to it which causes Rayman to lose a life point when
        he touches the spikes.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The Template and Example Maps
        contain handy scenery predrawn with blocks with the recommended Types
        already assigned to them. In the Mapper, when you copy any of this
        background scenery to your new level, you automatically copy the Block Types.&nbsp;You
        usually do not need to worry about changing these Block Types.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">There may be times when you want
        to change the default Types. The basic properties of blocks should be
        respected when choosing a new block Type. It may seem fun to have
        Rayman fall through a solid looking musical bar or drown on a grassy
        platform, but that is not good game design!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">You can assign Types to blocks in
        either the Mapper or in the Events Editor.&nbsp;(For detailed&nbsp;
        instructions see <a href="rdmaptyp.htm">Working
          with Block Types in the
        Mapper</a> or <a href="rdevnted.htm#types">Using the Events
              Editor</a>.) It is much easier to
        work with Block Types in the Mapper.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"> When you are building your
        background scenery, make sure you check the Block Types from time to
        time.
        This is especially important when you are building complex scenery from bits and pieces of different design units. You can
        mistakenly get Solid and Null Types intermixed and create platforms with
        holes or solid looking walls that Rayman can magically walk through!</font></p>

        <font face="Comic Sans MS">Null Type: </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Blocks
            with this type have no effect whatsoever on Rayman. This is the
        Block Type that is assigned to most of the &quot;empty&quot; space in a map
            and some of the background scenery such as the plants in the Jungle
            World. Rayman just walks in front of the scenery on the blocks with
            this Type.</font></p>
        <p><img border="0" src="images/typsolid.gif" alt="Solid Type" width="32" height="32">&nbsp;
        <font face="Comic Sans MS">Solid Type: </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">This
            is solid ground, allowing Rayman and other moving objects to walk on it. If this Block Type is used on a vertical wall, it will
            appear solid to Rayman and he will not be able to walk through it.</font></p>
        <p><img border="0" src="images/typpass.gif" alt="Pass-through Type" width="32" height="32">&nbsp;
        <font face="Comic Sans MS">Pass-through Type: </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">This
            is similar to the Solid Type, but Rayman can pass-through it from
            below to above. It is used for small platforms of one block
            thickness that Rayman can
            jump through, but still appear solid to him when he is standing on
            them. It is also used on the edges of larger, solid platforms to
        enhance the effect of the jagged edges of the platforms.</font></p>
      <img border="0" src="images/typup45.gif" alt="Slope Type" width="32" height="32"> <img border="0" src="images/typdn45.gif" alt="Slope Type" width="32" height="32">

      <font face="Comic Sans MS">Slope Types: </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">These
            allow Rayman and other game characters to move up and down on sloped hills.
      Blocks with the Slope Type have the same
            characteristics as the Pass-through Type. There are six different
            slope Types (two for steep 45-degree slopes, and four for 30-degree
            slopes). These Types can be found on the sloped grassy platforms in
            Jungle World, rocky paths in the Mountain and Cave Worlds, or
            chocolate bars in the Cake World.&nbsp;</font>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/typzflat.gif" alt="Slippery Type" width="32" height="32">&nbsp;
      <font face="Comic Sans MS">Slippery Type: </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Rayman
            slips and slides when he's on a Slippery Type. Rayman slips, but his
            enemies such as the Antitoons can walk on them! This Block Type has
            the same characteristics as the Pass-through Type. It is used on
            flat slippery surfaces such as the icy musical bars, black
            ink on the erasers in the Image World, and frosting in the Cake
            World.</font></p>

            <font face="Comic Sans MS">Slippery Slope Types: </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Slippery
            Slope Types combine the features of a Slope Type and the Slippery
            Type. As with the Slope Types, there are six different ones for
            steep or gradual slopes. These Types are usually used on slanted
            slippery surfaces such as slanted musical bars or steep snow-covered
            mountain paths.</font>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/typdrown.gif" alt="Water Type" width="32" height="32">&nbsp;
      <font face="Comic Sans MS">Water Type: </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">When
            Rayman contacts a Water Type, an animated sequence is triggered of
      him drowning. These types are usually associated with the water
            in the Jungle and Cave Worlds, and green syrup in the Cake World.</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/typspike.gif" alt="Death Type" width="32" height="32">&nbsp;
      <font face="Comic Sans MS">Death Type: </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">When
            Rayman touches a Death Type, he loses one life-point. When Rayman
            collides with one of these Types he is highlighted and for a brief
            moment he will not react to Types or enemies. Prickly surfaces such
            mountain and cave spikes, musical notes, and the containers with
            spikes in the Image World have the Death Type.</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/typdeath.gif" alt="Instant Death Type" width="32" height="32">&nbsp;
      <font face="Comic Sans MS">Instant Death Type: </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The
            Instant Death Type is only to be used to ensure the death of Rayman
            instead of deducting a life-point. It is used on musical notes which
            line the bottom of the screen, spikes at the bottom of pits in the
            Cave and Mountain Worlds, and some of the containers of spikes in
            the Image World.</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/typfall.gif" alt="Falling Type" width="32" height="32">&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS">Falling Type: </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">When
            Rayman has a fatal fall, these Types are put into position to
            trigger an animated sequence of him falling. For this animation
            to be credible, Falling Types must be placed at least 5 blocks below
            the platform from which Rayman falls. These Types are usually placed
            in empty space to ensure Rayman's death.</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/typbounc.gif" alt="Bounce Type" width="32" height="32">&nbsp;
      <font face="Comic Sans MS">Bounce Type: </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">(Usually
      used
            only in the Image World) When Rayman lands on a block with this
            Type, he automatically jumps. This Type is used on the top of the
            bouncy blue erasers in the Image World. The Bounce Type is similar
            to the Pass-through Type; Rayman can jump up through small one block
            thick platforms with this type. Although this Type can be used in
            the other Rayman worlds, it should only be used where it makes sense
            in a game. It would not be good game design to use it on a grassy
            path in the Jungle World!</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/typclimb.gif" alt="Climbing Type" width="32" height="32">&nbsp;
      <font face="Comic Sans MS">Climbing Type: </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">(Usually
      used
            only in the Jungle World) The only predrawn scenery elements which
      use this Type are
            the vines in the Jungle World. Rayman can cling onto and climb up
            the vines. With some creativity in the Mapper, this Type can be used in other
            worlds to simulate ropes or other objects that Rayman would
            logically climb.</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/typreact.gif" alt="Reactive Type" width="32" height="32">&nbsp;
      <font face="Comic Sans MS">Reactive Type: </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Usually
            positioned to constrain the movement of events such as platforms, clouds,
      and enemies events. For example, columns of Reactive Types are used
            to make a Horizontal Cloud move back and forth within an area on the screen. A
            box drawn of Reactive Types will constrain an Antitoon Flyer to a small
            region of the screen. (For more information, see the section on <i><a href="rdreactv.htm">Using
      Reactive Types</a></i>.)</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/typplant.gif" alt="Seed Type" width="32" height="32">&nbsp;
      <font face="Comic Sans MS">Seed Type: </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">(Can
      only be used in the Jungle World) In the Jungle Rayman can plant a seed
            which grows into a tall water lily that he can climb on. To allow
            him to do this, position two Seed Types next to each other. The
            Seed Types are usually placed on little mounds of dirt that are
            supposed to be the only logical places to grow these plants. If you
            want the water lily to be deadly, place a second row of Seed Types
            on top of the first.</font>

      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The above example is part of a map
      from the Jungle World. The water on either side of the grassy island has
      the Water Type. If Rayman falls into the water, he will drown. The bottom
      grassy platform has a gradually sloping hill with flat areas on both edges
      of the island. The blocks which make up the hill have Slope Types; the
      flat areas have the Solid Type. The platforms will
      feel solid to Rayman. The short vine between the bottom and second platform
      has the Climbing Type which means Rayman can climb up the vine. The
      topmost grassy platform has the Pass-through Type. Rayman can stand on the
      second platform and jump up through the topmost grassy platform to
      stand on it. The platform will be solid to walk on, but Rayman will not
      &quot;hit his head&quot; when he jumps. The edges of the second grassy
      platform are also Pass-through Types. This helps create the illusion that
      the edges of the grass are not completely solid. There are two Seed Types
      on the upper platform where the little pile of dirt can be seen in the
      normal view. This means Rayman can plant a water lily seed there. The rest of
      the background scenery has the Null Type; the Mapper just shows the
      scenery images on the Null blocks.</font><p>&nbsp;
