        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Problem: Your level has two
        platforms with a gap which is too wide for Rayman to jump. You put a
        &quot;Horizontal Cloud&quot; next to the platform, Rayman jumps onto the
        cloud, overshoots the platform and goes sailing off the right side of
        the screen. What went wrong?</font></p>

          <tr>
            <td><p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Solution: You must use columns of
        Reactive Types to restrict the area in which you want the cloud to move
        back and forth. If you don't use Reactive Types, the Horizontal Cloud
        will continue moving until it reaches the edge of the map. The image to
              the right shows how the Reactive Types look when you press 'T' in
              the Events Editor and display the Types.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Reactive Types are used to limit
        the movement of moving platforms such as pink rings, clouds, pencil sharpeners and water lilies.
        Some enemies such as the moving blue prickly balls and flying Antitoons
        can also be controlled by Reactive Types. Columns of Reactive Types
        are used to stop events which move horizontally; rows of Reactive Types
        stop events which move vertically; and boxes of Reactive Types are used
        to control events such as the flying Antitoons. Reactive Types have no
        effect on Rayman.</font></p>

              move vertically. The row of Reactive Types just above the rocky
              floor and below the cavern ceiling define the up and down limits
              of the two vertical blue prickly balls. The blue prickly ball near
              the torch moves horizontally. The vertical walls of Reactive Types
              restrict its movement.</font></p>

        Reactive Types either the Mapper or in the Events Editor. It is
        much easier to work with Block Types in the Mapper, especially if
        objects in the background scenery visually delimit where the walls
        should be placed. If the Reactive Types are to be placed &quot;in mid
        air&quot;, it may be easier to wait until you are in the Events Editor
        and can see the relative size and placement of the events you are trying
        to restrict.&nbsp; (For more information, see <a href="rdmaptyp.htm">Working
        with Block Types in the Mapper</a> or <a href="rdevnted.htm#types">Using
