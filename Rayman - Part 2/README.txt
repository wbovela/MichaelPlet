This is a mixed collection of documents and files I have used in developing Rayman for the C64.

The most important files are probably:

X and Y scroll values at scroll speed 1.txt     - Relates fine scroll values to scrolling direction
X and Y scroll values at scroll speed 4.txt     - Relates fine scroll values to scrolling direction
VB\BinMap to TxtMap\ and VB\TxtMap to BinMap\   - The programs I use when I want to change the map design
DSC06307.jpg and Flowchart - Bottom IRQ.pptx    - Shows what happens in each interrupt
Notes - old.txt                                 - Important thought about separating scrolling and game mechanics

But you decide!

Beware! Some of the description may not be accurate anymore. Look at the dates.
