The C64 code of Michael Plet

This repository contains the works of Michael Plet who passed away on February 12th 2022.

Michael's wish was for his work not to be lost, so this repository contains the results of his disassembly and analysis of C64 games he loved.

Please share this repository and let it be known that Michael contributed this to the C64 community.

Michael was known as Tyrosaurus on Youtube ( https://www.youtube.com/user/Tyrosaurus ). He was working on a game inspired by Rayman, called Rayman64. An 8 way scrolling platformer. Sadly, he never got to finish his game.
