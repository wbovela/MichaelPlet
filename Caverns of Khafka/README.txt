The important files are:

CAVERNS OF KAFKA - Disassembly.txt - The disassembly
CAVERNS OF KAFKA.PRG               - The binary file on which the disassembly is based


How to run:
Load CAVERNS OF KAFKA.PRG into CCS64 or VICE and type SYS4096


Tools used:

-	My own old VB6 program to make the initial disassemly file
-	UltraEdit for editing and adding comments to the disassembly file (TABs will not line up in Notepad)
-	CCS64 to deduce stuff (using breakpoints and my patched versions of the games)
