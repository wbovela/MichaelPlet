The important files are:

Royal Rescue (1989)(Compute!).txt - The disassembly
Royal Rescue (1989)(Compute!).prg - The binary file on which the disassembly is based


How to run:
Load Royal Rescue (1989)(Compute!).prg into CCS64 (or VICE)


Tools used:

-	My own old VB6 program to make the initial disassemly file
-	UltraEdit for editing and adding comments to the disassembly file (TABs will not line up in Notepad)
-	CCS64 to deduce stuff (using breakpoints and my patched versions of the games)
