This is a VB6 program to locate C64 screen RAM(s) in a PRG file.
I use it as a tool to assist in my disassembling of C64 games.

The zip-fil contains the entire VB 6.0 project.
After extracting rename the .xe file to .exe

To run start Find Screen.exe and use the menu to navigate to and select a PRG file.
Then use the up/down controls to scroll through bank, screen and charset until you see the right image.
