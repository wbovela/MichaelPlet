This is a VB6 program to convert a PRG file to a file with sprite images as comments.
I use it as a tool to assist in my disassembling of C64 games.

The zip-fil contains the entire VB 6.0 project.
After extracting rename the .xe file to .exe

To run start PRG to Sprites v2.exe and use the menu to navigate to and select a PRG file.
Then click the Make Sprites button.

The program makes two files in the same folder where the .exe file is.
One output file interpretes the sprites as Hires and the other one a Multicolor.
The program converts the entire 64K memory. Just copy the relevant part to the disassembly file.
